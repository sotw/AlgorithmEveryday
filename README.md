## AlgorithmEveryday

I share equal love among C plus plus and Python3.  
I tend to use python3 as my first priority to solve problem.  
Because I need to make my algorithm quick enough to pass through the online test mechanism.  
But if I can't make my python3 code quick enough, I will go back to use C plusplus, I don't really care about online ranking. Make python3 quick enough is good challenge for me enough.  

You are welcome to discuss with me. 

Btw, after working in decade, I finnally realize algorithm and math is the core of problem. Well, it's true other topic is worthy to invest time. But alas. time is limited.

[UVA100]|3n+1|C++ pass the online judge without a problem, but python just can't. the logical is identical..dunno why.| N|Y
[UVA10038]|Jolly Jumper|easy one. Python3 is quick enough | Y||
[UVA621]|secret research|easy one, just get familiar with Python3|Y
[UVA1124]|Celebrity jeopardy| well, what the..|Y|
[UVA1614]|Hell on Markets| Fun one, I took some time with this one.And I found I am the only one who use python3 to solve it at this moment. The rank is pretty bad. Hahaha...| Y|
[UVA10963]|The Swallowing Ground| Interesting question, but easy one, output format is annoying. Receving some presentation error mulitple times, not happy.:(|Y|
[UVA369]|Combination|Basic is important, right?|Y|
[UVA1210]|Sum of Consecutive Prime| Well, I had to admit, this one give me some trouble because I need to revive my math. You high school nerd won't understand. Only aging will make you understand what I am talking about. |Y|
[UVA591]|Box of Bricks| Well, easy one. nothing to say|Y|
[UVA900]|Brick Wall Patterns|er.. well, let's build the wall with stylish patterns.|Y||
